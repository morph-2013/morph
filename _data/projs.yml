#  description: Shot noise has been suggested for a long time as a tell-tale probe for Majorana bound states. We are the first to carry out local tunneling shot noise measurements on the putative vortex Majorana states.

#  description: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when pathogens evolve to resist medicines used to treat their infection. WHO has declared it as one of the top health threats to humanity. Our lab, along with our collaborators in SComB and the e-Asia JRP ATTACK-AMR project, is using metagenomics to understand the abundance and diversity of AMR-related genes in hospital wastewaters. Another angle of attack on AMR is phage therapy, an alternative to conventional antibiotics, the heavy and loosely regulated use of which has been exacerbating the AMR crisis. Given that lab experiments to study phages can be costly and tedious, our lab is investigating state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to aid in phage characterization.
